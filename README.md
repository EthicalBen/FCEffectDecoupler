#FCEffectDecoupler:
**Requires** both Plasma Katanas as well as Custom Sabers to be present/installed.
(Also requires BS Utils)

#Credit/Permission/Backstory:
Ikeiwa is the person who originally created the Plasma Katanas.
I do not take credit for any of the assets, nor does this project host them.
You **need** the Plasma Katanas as well as Custom Sabers for this mod to do anything.

Plasma Katanas:
Many people love them.
One big contributor to this is their Full Combo effect.
Some people use the Plasma Katanas specifically **because** of their Full Combo effect, and would like to use different saber pairs.
Obviously this would mean they'd to lose the amazing Full Combo effect.
I've been asked to seperate their FC Effect, and make it apply to any Custom Saber.
Permission to (ab)use the Plasma Katanas for this has been granted by Ikeiwa.

#Usage:
Having the mod installed causes the FC effect to be ripped from the Plasma Katanas, and applied globally.
Using any non-default saber-pair will trigger the effect to appear if a full combo is achieved.

#Confirmed to work on:
Custom Sabers 4.0.1
