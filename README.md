#FCEffectDecoupler
**Requires** both Plasma Katanas as well as Custom Sabers to be present/installed.
(Also requires BS Utils)

#Usage:
Having the mod installed causes the FC effect to be ripped from the Plasma Katanas, and applied globally.
Using any non-default saber-pair will trigger the effect to appear if a full combo is achieved.

#Confirmed to work on:
Custom Sabers 4.0.1
